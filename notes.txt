- wapiti - modules, only one page; target up to first /, then path in each vuln
- nikto - everything, can't specify pages; scheme from file -> host field -> if port not 443, 80 then port -> url field in vulns
- nuclei - disable interactsh server for OAST testing, exclude OAST based templates; url field
- zap - weird spider; uri in instances

TODO
- make paths ambiguous
- --no-informational??
