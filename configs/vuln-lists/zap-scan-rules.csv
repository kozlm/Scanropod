passive,Missing Anti-clickjacking Header,"This scan rule checks for the existence and validity of the X-Frame-Options header, or Content-Security-Policy ‘frame-ancestors’ directive. At MEDIUM and HIGH thresholds this only looks at non-error or non-redirect HTML responses. At LOW threshold it looks at all text responses including errors and redirects. The following conditions may result in an alert: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header: If the X-Frame-Options header is missing from the response completely. Multiple X-Frame-Options Header Entries: When more than one X-Frame-Options header is detected on the response. X-Frame-Options Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec): A “http-equiv” entry was found in the response that attempts to define X-Frame-Options, which is not supported by the specification. X-Frame-Options Setting Malformed: The header is present with no value, or the value is not as expected (i.e.: other than “DENY”, or “SAMEORIGIN”).

passive,Application Errors,"Check server responses for HTTP 500 - Internal Server Error type responses or those that contain a known error string. Note: Matches made within script blocks or files are against the entire content not only comments. Skips responses that contain ISO control characters (those which are likely binary files). At HIGH Threshold don’t alert on HTTP 500 (but do for other error patterns). Also, such known error strings are much less likely to be relevant in static pages like JS / CSS so these files are only scanned at LOW threshold. For Internal Server Error (HTTP 500) the Alert is set to Low risk and in other case it is set to Medium risk. Note: If the Custom Payloads add-on is installed you can add your own Application Error strings (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel.
They will also be searched for in responses as they’re passively scanned. Keep in mind that the greater the number of payloads the greater the

passive,Off-site Redirect,This check looks at user-supplied input in query string parameters and POST data to identify where open redirects might be possible. Open redirects occur when an application allows user-supplied input (e.g. http://nottrusted.com ) to control an off-site destination. This is generally a pretty accurate way to find where 301 or 302 redirects could be exploited by spammers or phishing attacks. NOTE : For the purposes of the passive check the authority portion of the origin and destination were compared. Manual testing may be required to validate the impact of this finding.,10028,https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10028/,3,601
passive,PII Disclosure,"PII is information like credit card number, SSN etc. This check currently reports only numbers which match credit card numbers and pass Luhn checksum, which gives high confidence, that this is a credit card number. At MEDIUM and HIGH threshold it attempts to use three characters of context on each side of potential matches to exclude matches within decimal like content or content which includes underscores. At LOW threshold, alerts will be raised for such matches. At MEDIUM and HIGH threshold, the following content types are evaluated: HTML (visible text and script blocks) JSON XML Image and CSS files are always ignored. Every other content type is evaluated at LOW threshold. Additionally at LOW threshold the entire HTML response is evaluated. Note: In the case of suspected credit card values, the potential credit card numbers are looked up against a Bank Identification Number List
(BINList). If a match is found the alert is raised at High confidence and additional details are added to the ‘Other Information’ field in the
alert, otherwise the alerts will have Medium confidence.

active,Remote OS Command Injection (Time Based),This rule injects *NIX and Windows OS commands to determine whether or not the web application is passing unchecked user input directly to the underlying OS. The rule will attempt blind injection attack(s) by submitting sleep instructions as the payload and comparing the elapsed time between sending the request and receiving the response against a heuristic time-delay lower limit. Post 2.5.0 you can change the length of time used for the blind injection attack by changing the rules.common.sleep parameter via the Options ‘Rule configuration’ panel.,90037,https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90037/,3,78

It then performs a series of attacks specifically targeted at the location in which each of the instances occurs, including tag attributes, URL attributes, attributes in tags which support src attributes, html comments etc. Note: This rule only scans HTTP PUT requests at LOW threshold. If the alert threshold is set to LOW, XSS injection located in a JSON response results in a LOW risk and LOW confidence alert is raised. For other response content-types a LOW confidence alert is raised. If the alert threshold is set to either MEDIUM or HIGH, XSS injection located in non-HTML responses do not generate alerts.

If the response code is 401 (Unauthorized) or 403 (Forbidden) or the content checks are un-successful then an alert is raised with lower confidence (at LOW Threshold). Note: If the Custom Payloads add-on is installed you can add your own hidden file paths (payloads) in the Custom Payloads options panel. The Custom Payloads category for this rule is: Hidden-File . For custom payloads only the response status code is checked.
